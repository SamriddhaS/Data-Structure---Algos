1. What are coroutines in Kotlin?

    Coroutines are Kotlin’s native solution for writing asynchronous, non-blocking code. 
    They allow developers to write sequential code that looks like traditional synchronous code 
    while taking advantage of suspending functions and structured concurrency.

2. Differentiate between launch and async. When would you choose one over the other in a real-world scenario?

    Both launch and async are coroutine builders used to start a new coroutine. 
    The key difference lies in their purpose and return type.

        launch: This is for "fire-and-forget" tasks where you don't need a result. 
        It returns a Job object, which represents the coroutine's lifecycle and can 
        be used for cancellation or waiting for its completion (job.join()). 
        If an exception is thrown inside a launch block, it will propagate up 
        the coroutine hierarchy and crash the app if not handled.

        async: This is for tasks that return a result. It returns a Deferred<T> object, 
        which is a non-blocking future. The result can be retrieved by calling .await(). 
        Exceptions thrown in an async block are deferred until .await() is called.

    Real-world scenario: 
    Imagine a user profile screen that needs to load the user's details and 
    their most recent posts from two different API endpoints.

    suspend fun loadProfileData() = coroutineScope {
        // async is perfect here because we need to retrieve results from both calls
        val userDeferred = async { apiService.fetchUser(userId) }
        val postsDeferred = async { apiService.fetchPosts(userId) }

        try {
            // We await both results to get the data
            val user = userDeferred.await()
            val posts = postsDeferred.await()

            // Update the UI with the combined data
            updateUi(user, posts)

        } catch (e: Exception) {
            // Handle network errors for both calls in one place
            showError(e)
        }
    }

    // launch is for side effects, like logging
    viewModelScope.launch {
        loggingService.logEvent("User profile screen loaded") // No result needed, just fire-and-forget
    }

3. How do you handle exceptions in coroutines, and what's the difference between using try-catch, CoroutineExceptionHandler, and SupervisorJob?

    This is a critical topic for senior-level developers to ensure application stability. 
    The default behavior of structured concurrency is that if a child coroutine fails, 
    it cancels its parent and all other sibling coroutines, causing the whole scope to fail.

        try-catch: This is the most common and direct way to handle exceptions. It works just like in synchronous code,
        catching exceptions thrown within the try block. For async, the try-catch must be around the .await() call, 
        as that's when the exception is thrown. For launch, the try-catch should be inside the launch block itself.

        CoroutineExceptionHandler: This is a global, catch-all mechanism for unhandled exceptions within a coroutine scope. 
        It's an optional element in the CoroutineContext. It's particularly useful for handling exceptions from launch 
        that are not wrapped in a try-catch. The handler will be invoked when a coroutine fails and is a good place to 
        log the crash or show a general error message. It's important to remember that CoroutineExceptionHandler is not 
        invoked for async and does not prevent the parent from being canceled.

        SupervisorJob: This is a special type of Job that changes the default cancellation behavior. With a SupervisorJob, 
        the failure of a child coroutine does not automatically cancel the parent or its other children. This is perfect for
        situations where you have multiple independent tasks and want to continue the other tasks even if one of them fails.

    Real-world scenario: Consider a screen with multiple widgets, each loading data from a different source.
    
    // Create a scope with a SupervisorJob and an exception handler
    val widgetScope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.IO + CoroutineExceptionHandler { _, throwable ->
        // Log the error and show a toast
        Log.e("WidgetLoader", "Widget failed to load: $throwable")
    })

    fun loadAllWidgets() {
        // Launch each widget's loading process in a separate coroutine
        widgetScope.launch {
            // This widget might fail, but it won't cancel the others
            loadImportantWidgetData()
        }
        
        widgetScope.launch {
            // This widget is independent and should continue even if the other one fails
            loadSocialFeedData()
        }
    }

    /////////////////// 

    runBlocking {
    supervisorScope {
        launch(handler) {
            println("Child 1 start")
            throw RuntimeException("Boom")
        }
        launch {
            println("Child 2 start")
            delay(1000)
            println("Child 2 end") // Will run
        }
    }
}


    In this case, if loadImportantWidgetData() throws an exception, the CoroutineExceptionHandler 
    will log the error, but the coroutine for loadSocialFeedData() will continue to run, preventing 
    a catastrophic failure of the entire screen. This is a common pattern for dashboards or screens 
    with multiple independent data sources.

4. Dispatchers in Coroutines ? 
    Coroutine Dispatchers in Kotlin determine which thread or thread pool your coroutine will run on.
    
    Main Coroutine Dispatchers
    Kotlin provides these built-in dispatchers (from kotlinx.coroutines):

    | Dispatcher                   | Runs On                                               | Best For                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Dispatchers.Main`**       | Main/UI thread                                        | Updating UI, handling user interactions.                              |
| **`Dispatchers.IO`**         | Optimized thread pool for blocking I/O                | Network requests, database queries, file read/write.                  |
| **`Dispatchers.Default`**    | Shared background thread pool                         | CPU-intensive tasks like sorting, JSON parsing, complex calculations. |
| **`Dispatchers.Unconfined`** | Starts in the current thread but can resume elsewhere | Advanced cases (not usually recommended for regular app logic).       |



5. Coroutines and Threads ? 
    Good Expalintaion with Example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jwtgF8FDHU
    Threads : 
    Threads are a form of preemptive multitasking. The operating system's scheduler decides when to switch between threads, 
    often based on a time slice. Each thread has its own stack and a unique program counter, but they share the same memory 
    space within a process.

        Operating System Control: The OS is responsible for context switching, which involves saving the state of one thread 
        and loading the state of another. This is a relatively heavyweight operation as it requires a system call to the kernel.

        Parallelism: Threads can run in parallel on multiple CPU cores. If a program is CPU-bound (doing a lot of computation), 
        using multiple threads can significantly speed it up.

        Shared Memory: Because threads share memory, communication between them is straightforward but can lead to complex issues 
        like race conditions and deadlocks. Programmers must use synchronization mechanisms like mutexes and semaphores to protect 
        shared data.

        Blocking Operations: When a thread performs a blocking operation (like waiting for I/O), the entire thread is put to sleep. 
        The OS can then schedule another thread to run on that core.

    Coroutines

    Coroutines, on the other hand, use cooperative multitasking. The program itself decides when to pause a coroutine and 
    switch to another. This is done explicitly by the programmer using keywords like await or yield. When a coroutine encounters a 
    blocking operation, it suspends itself and returns control to the event loop. The event loop can then resume other coroutines that
    are ready to run.

        Program Control: Coroutines are managed by a coroutine scheduler within the program. The context switching is done in user 
        space, not the kernel. This makes the switch much faster and more efficient, making them lightweight.

        Single-Threaded by Default: A common misconception is that coroutines always run on a single thread. While this is true 
        for many popular implementations (like Python's asyncio), it's not a strict rule. The key is that a group of coroutines 
        can be run on a single thread. They don't run in parallel; they run concurrently by taking turns.

        Non-Blocking by Design: Coroutines are designed for asynchronous operations, particularly for I/O-bound tasks. 
        When a coroutine awaits an I/O operation (like a network request), it doesn't block the thread. Instead, it suspends its 
        execution, allowing the thread to do other work, such as running a different coroutine.

        Explicit State Management: Since the coroutine's state is managed by the program, it doesn't need to save and restore a
        full thread context. This is what makes them "lightweight."


    How Coroutines Use Threads

    Coroutines don't replace threads; they work on top of them. A typical coroutine framework uses one or more threads to 
    execute the coroutines. A single thread, often called an event loop, is responsible for scheduling and executing the coroutines.

    A single thread is more than sufficient for thousands of coroutines that are mostly waiting for I/O. For instance, 
    in a web server, one thread can handle hundreds of client connections concurrently by using coroutines.

    When a coroutine needs to perform a CPU-bound task that would block the event loop, it's a common practice to offload 
    that task to a separate thread pool. This is where coroutines and threads can work together. The coroutine will await the 
    result of the task running on another thread, and the event loop can continue to process other coroutines in the meantime. 
    This prevents the single event loop from being blocked and ensures the application remains responsive.

6. What is the difference between launch and runBlocking functions in coroutines?

    launch is a coroutine builder that starts a new coroutine and returns a Job object immediately without blocking the current thread. 
    It is typically used for fire-and-forget style coroutines.

    runBlocking is a coroutine builder that blocks the current thread until the coroutine inside it is completed. 
    It is mainly used for writing tests or running top-level coroutine code.   

7. What is coroutine scope ? 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fgemini.google.com%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjQsMTY0NTAz&v=0GuTxesWnPs&feature=youtu.be

    A coroutine scope is a concept that keeps track of all coroutines started within it. It provides structured concurrency, 
    meaning all coroutines within a scope can be managed and canceled together. This makes it easier to avoid memory leaks, 
    manage resources, and control the coroutine lifecycle effectively.

    When you launch a coroutine, it runs within a scope. The scope defines:

        Context: The execution context in which the coroutine will run (like the thread pool).
        Job: A handle that tracks the state of the coroutine and controls its cancellation.

    Creating Coroutine Scopes

    You can create a coroutine scope using CoroutineScope() or within structured concurrency builders like launch or async. 
    Scopes are typically used to group and control multiple coroutines.

    1. GlobalScope: (Not recommended for most use cases)

        This scope is tied to the application’s lifetime and is used to launch coroutines that live for the entire duration of the app.
        Coroutines launched in GlobalScope are not bound to any specific lifecycle, so they are not easily canceled.

    GlobalScope.launch {
        // Running in a global scope, won't stop until the app stops
        println("Running in GlobalScope")
    }

    Caution: Using GlobalScope can lead to memory leaks or resource mismanagement if not handled properly. It is generally 
    recommended to use structured scopes tied to the lifecycle of components, like ViewModel or Activity.

    2. CoroutineScope:

        This is the most commonly used scope, which allows you to manage coroutines within specific contexts.
        For instance, you can create a custom scope for a particular block of code or tie it to lifecycle-aware components.

    fun doSomething() {
        CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default).launch {
            // Coroutines launched here will follow the scope's lifecycle
            executeTask()
        }
    }

    The above scope uses Dispatchers.Default, which is optimized for CPU-intensive tasks.
    3. Lifecycle-Aware Scopes (Best practice for Android development)

        In Android development, it’s crucial to tie coroutines to the lifecycle of components like ViewModel, Activity, or Fragment. 
        This helps manage coroutine cancellation when the component is destroyed.
        For example, viewModelScope is a predefined scope that automatically cancels all coroutines when the ViewModel is cleared.

    viewModelScope.launch {
        executeTask()
    }

    Similarly, lifecycleScope is a scope available within activities and fragments:

    lifecycleScope.launch {
        executeTask()
    }

8. What is the purpose of withContext in coroutines?

    withContext is a suspending function that allows you to switch the coroutine's context to a different dispatcher. 
    It suspends the current coroutine, switches to the specified dispatcher, executes the provided block of code, and 
    then resumes the coroutine in its original context.    

9. What are coroutine builders?

    Coroutine builders are functions that create and start coroutines. Some common coroutine builders in Kotlin include 
    launch, async, runBlocking, and withContext.


10. Explain the Looper, Handler, and MessageQueue in Android.

    These three components are the foundation of Android's main thread and are used for handling asynchronous tasks and UI updates.

        Looper: A Looper is a component that "loops" and continuously pulls messages from a MessageQueue. 
        The main thread has its own Looper.

        MessageQueue: A queue of messages and runnables. When you post a task to the main thread, 
        it's added to this queue.

        Handler: A Handler is used to send messages and runnables to a Looper's MessageQueue. 
        It's associated with a specific thread and is the primary way to interact with the main thread from a background thread.
