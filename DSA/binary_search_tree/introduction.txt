    Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion – Important Concept Note

    Key Idea:
    In a Binary Search Tree (BST), new nodes are always inserted at a leaf position,
    never by rearranging or inserting “in between” existing nodes.

    Common Misconception
    “If a value lies between two nodes (e.g., 30 and 40), it must be placed between them structurally.”

    This is incorrect.
        - BSTs do not enforce physical placement
        - They enforce value range constraints across ancestors

    Initial BST:

            50
           /  \
         30    70
        / \   / \
      20  40 60  80

    Insert value: 35

    Resulting BST:

            50
           /  \
         30    70
        / \   / \
      20  40 60  80
          /
         35

    Why this is STILL a valid BST
        35 > 30 → must be in the right subtree of 30 ✅
        35 < 40 → must be in the left subtree of 40 ✅
        Node 35 is placed at the first null position following BST rules
    ✔️ No existing nodes are moved
    ✔️ No parent-child relationships are broken

    Final Takeaway :
        BST insertion always happens at a leaf
        Nodes are placed based on comparisons, not position
        The structure emerges naturally from recursive insertion
        Logical ordering ≠ physical placement
